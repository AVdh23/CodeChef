You are given 2 integers - 
 
A and 
 
C.
You need to find if there exists any 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
integer 
 
B which meets the following condition

 
B must be an integer
 
B is the average of 
 
A and 
 
C.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
 
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers 
 
A and 
 
C, the given integers.
Output Format
For each test case, output 
−
1
−1 if there exists no integer 
 
B which is the average of 
 
A and 
 
C. Else, output the value of 
 
B.
