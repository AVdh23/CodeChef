Let us start with the very basics of array construction and manipulation.

Task
Given an integer 
 
N, create an array 
 
A of length 
 
N consisting of the first 
 
N integers - 
[
1
,
2
,
3
,
.
.
.
,
 
]
[1,2,3,...,N].
You need to output the following

Output the array 
 
A
Output the array 
 
A sorted in a descending order
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
 
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input - the integer 
 
N.
Sample 1:
Input
Output
2
3
4
1 2 3 
3 2 1 
1 2 3 4 
4 3 2 1 
Explanation:
Test case 1: 
 
N is 3.
Hence 
 
=
123
A=123
 
A sorted in descending order = 3 2 1
