Numerical characters in strings
Prev problem
Next problem
Recall that for some programming problems, it is beneficial to treat numbers as strings.

You are given 2 integers 
 
A and 
 
B - they contain the same number of digits.
You need to determine if these numbers are reverse of each other.

Input Format
The first line will contain 
 
t - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow
Each line of the test case consists of a two line of input
the number 
 
A on the 
1
 
 
1 
st
  line and
the number 
 
B on the 
2
 
 
2 
nd
  line
Output Format
Each test case output 'YES' if the numbers are reverses of each other and 'NO' otherwise
Sample 1:
Input
Output
2
1005
5001
12345
53321
YES
NO
Explanation:
Test case 1: 
5001
5001 when reversed gives us 
1005
1005. Hence we output 
 
 
 
YES

Test case 2: 
12345
12345 when reversed does NOT equal 
53321
53321. Hence we output 
 
 
NO
