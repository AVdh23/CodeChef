Problem
You are given an integer array 
 
A of size 
 
N.
A triplet array is defined as the collection of 
min
⁡
(
 
 
,
 
 
,
 
 
)
min(A 
i
​
 ,A 
j
​
 ,A 
k
​
 ) for all triplets 
(
 
,
 
,
 
)
(i,j,k), where 
1
≤
 
<
 
<
 
≤
 
1≤i<j<k≤N.

You are given 
 
Q queries of the following type:

Given an integer 
 
K, return the value of 
 
 
ℎ
K 
th
  smallest element in the triplet array.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
 
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers 
 
N and 
 
Q — the size of array 
 
A and the number of queries, respectively.
The second line of each test case contains 
 
N space-separated integers

​
 ,A

​
 ,…,A

​
 .
The following 
 
Q lines describe the queries. Each of these lines contain a single positive integer 
 
K.
Output Format
For each query, print a single line containing the 
 
 
ℎ
K 
th
  smallest element in the triplet array.
