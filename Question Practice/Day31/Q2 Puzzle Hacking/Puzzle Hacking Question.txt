Puzzle Hacking - Solution
In an exam center - 
 
A students have to sit on seats assigned by their id number.
Each bench has 
5
5 seats and can take 
5
5 students. So students with id 
1
1 to 
5
5 sit on the 
 
 
 
 
ℎ
1
Bench1, 
6
6 to 
10
10 sit on the 
 
 
 
 
ℎ
2
Bench2 and so on.
Student with id number 
 
B skips the exam. Hence, student with id 
 
+
1
B+1 sits in the seat assigned to 
 
B. Every subsequent student then shifts to the previous seat.
Due to the above, some students are no longer sitting on the original Bench assigned to them.
Help determine the invigilator how many students are seated on a Bench different than assigned.

Input Format
First line will contain 
 
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, two space-separated integers 
 
A and 
 
B denoting the total number of examinees and student id who skipped the exam.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer denoting the count of students seated on a bench different than assigned.
