Let us solve a problem on binary strings
You are given 2 separate binary strings - 
 
A and 
 
B - both of equal length.
You need to output the following

Count of '1's in each string
Count of indices (
 
i) where 
 
[
 
]
=
 
[
 
]
A[i]=B[i]
Input Format
The first line will contain 
 
t - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow
Each test case consists of two lines of input
the string 
 
A on the 
1
 
 
1 
st
  line and
the string 
 
B on the 
2
 
 
2 
nd
  line
Output Format
Each test case should contain 1 line of output, with three space separated integers

Explanation
Test case 1 The number of '1's in 
 
A is 2.
The number of '1's in 
 
B is 1.
For 4 indices - A[i] = B[i].

Test case 1 The number of '1's in 
 
A is 3.
The number of '1's in 
 
B is 2.
For 2 indices - A[i] = B[i].
