Next Module
For some programming problems, it is beneficial to treat numbers as strings.

You are given an integer 
 
A.
Can the digits of 
 
A be rearranged such that the resulting number is divisible by 
5
5

Input Format
The first line will contain 
 
t - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow
Each line of the test case consists of a single line of input - the number 
 
A
Output Format
For each test case output 'YES' if the number 
 
A can be rearranged such that it becomes divisible by 
5
5, and 'NO' otherwise
Sample 1
Input
Output
3
12345
11011
12346
Yes
Yes
No
Explanation
Test case 1 
12345
12345 is already divisible by 5 - hence output is YES

Test case 2 
11011
11011 can be rearranged as 
11110
11110 which is divisible by 5 - hence output is YES

Test case 3 No arrangement of 
12346
12346 makes it divisible by 5. Hence output is NO
