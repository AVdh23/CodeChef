We are given a binary string 
 
A of length 
 
N.
 
N is necessarily even.
We need to do the following operation on the string as we traverse it from left to right.

00 is converted to A
01 is converted to T
10 is converted to C
11 is converted to G
Print the output once the above operations have been carried out on the whole string.

Input Format
First line will contain 
 
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains two lines of input.
First line contains a single integer 
 
N, the length the original string.
Second line contains a binary string 
 
A of length 
 
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the new sequence once the conversion has been carried out.

Note: Output is case-sensitive.
