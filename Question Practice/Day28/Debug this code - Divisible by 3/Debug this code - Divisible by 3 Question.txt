Debug this code - Divisible by 3
Prev problem
You have two non-negative integers 
 
A and 
 
B.
In one operation, you can do either of the following:

 
:
=
∣
 
−
 
∣
A:=∣A−B∣ (ie. change 
 
A to 
∣
 
−
 
∣
∣A−B∣)
 
:
=
∣
 
−
 
∣
B:=∣A−B∣ (ie. change 
 
B to 
∣
 
−
 
∣
∣A−B∣)
Note that 
∣
 
∣
∣X∣ denotes absolute value of 
 
X. For example 
∣
−
7
∣
=
7
∣−7∣=7 and 
∣
4
∣
=
4
∣4∣=4.
Find the minimum number of operations after which at least one integer out of 
 
A and 
 
B becomes divisible by 
3
3.

Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer 
 
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of 
 
T test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integers 
 
A and 
 
B.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the minimum number of operations after which at least one integer out of 
 
A and 
 
B becomes divisible by 
3
3.

Explanation:
Test case

A=∣A−B∣=∣1−1∣=0. Now 
 
=
0
A=0 is divisible by
