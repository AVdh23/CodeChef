Kepler’s Law states that the planets move around the sun in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus.
Kepler's 3rd law is The Law of Periods, according to which

The square of the time period of the planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of its orbit.
You are given the Time periods (

 ) of two planets orbiting the same star.
Please determine if the Law of Periods is satisfied or not, i.e, if the constant of proportionality of both planets is the same.

Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer 
 
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of 
 
T test cases follows.
Each test case consists a single line of input, containing four space-separated integers
