You are given an integer 
 
N.
Find if it is possible to represent 
 
N as the sum of several (possibly zero) 
2
2's and several (possibly zero) 
7
7's.

Formally, find if there exist two integers 
 
,
 
 
(

0
)
X,Y (X,Y≥0) such that

=
 
2⋅X+7⋅Y=N.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
 
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing an integer 
 
N.
Output Format
For each test case, print on a new line YES if it is possible to represent 
 
N as the sum of several(possibly zero) 
2
2's and several(possibly zero) 
7
7's and NO otherwise.
