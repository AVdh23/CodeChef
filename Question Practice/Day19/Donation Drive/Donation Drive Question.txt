Problem
A blood drive aims to collect 
 
N number of blood donations.
The drive has collected 
 
X donations so far. Find the remaining number of donations needed to reach the target.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
 
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two space-separated integers 
 
N and 
 
X — the number of required donations and the number of collected donations, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the remaining number of donations needed to reach the target.

Explanation:
Test case 
1
1: The drive aims to collect 
5
5 donations and has collected 
2
2 already. Thus, they need to collect 
3
3 more donations to reach the target.

Test case 
2
2: The drive aims to collect 
3
3 donations and has collected 
3
3 already. Thus, they need to collect no more donations to reach the target.

Test case 
3
3: The drive aims to collect 
5
5 donations and has collected 
4
4 already. Thus, they need to collect 
1
1 more donation to reach the target.

Test case 
4
4: The drive aims to collect 
7
7 donations and has collected 
5
5 already. Thus, they need to collect 
2
2 more donations to reach the target.
